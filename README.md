This project consists of several bug-finding tools that look for memory
protection errors in the C source code of [R](http://www.r-project.org/) and packages.  

A number of bugs have been found and fixed using this tool in
[R-devel](https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/).
The tool can also be used to find errors in R packages (e.g.  from
CRAN/BIOC).

One can use a pre-installed virtual machine with `rchk` (or, more precisely,
use an automated script that installs such machine without user
intervention, into virtualbox or docker).  Also, one can install into a
singularity container ([instructions](image/README_SINGULARITY.md) and
configuration contributed by B.  W.  Lewis).

The native installation of dependencies for the tool is somewhat involved.
Branch llvm-38 has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04.2 (but it may be better to
use the latest version of `rchk` due to recent changes in R, see below).

Manual installation on Ubuntu 16.04.2 (branch llvm-38):

0. Install build dependencies for R:
	1. enable source repositories in `/etc/apt/sources.list`
	2. `apt-get build-dep -y r-base-dev`
	3. `apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev`
1. Install clang and llvm: `apt-get install clang-3.8 llvm-3.8-dev clang\+\+-3.8 clang llvm-dev libc++-dev libc++abi-dev`
2. Install [WLLVM scripts](https://github.com/travitch/whole-program-llvm):
	1. `apt-get install python-pip`
	2. `pip install --upgrade pip`
	3. `pip install --user DIR` where DIR is checked-out WLLVM
3. Install [rchk](https://github.com/kalibera/rchk.git), use *branch llvm-38*:
	1. `make`
	2. modify script `scripts/config.inc` (set root of LLVM, WLLVM, and rchk), LLVM can be `/usr` on Ubuntu 16.04.2

The master branch of the tool should now be used with LLVM 4.0, which is
part of Ubuntu 17.04 (and also tested on Ubuntu 17.10).  The tool can be
used also with [LLVM binary distributions](http://llvm.org/releases/download.html).

It is extremely unlikely that the `master` version of the tool will work
with any other version of LLVM than 4.0 due to frequent changes in LLVM API. 
An older version working with LLVM 3.8 is on the `llvm-38` branch and for
LLVM 3.6 on the `llvm-36` branch, but those branches are no longer updated.

Alternatively, one can install automatically into a VirtualBox image (this
will now use LLVM 3.8 and Ubuntu 16.04.2).

1. Install (manually) [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads), e.g. `apt-get install virtualbox`
2. Install (manually) [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), e.g. `apt-get install vagrant`
3. Install (automatically) R build dependencies, LLVM, WLLVM and rchk: run `vagrant up` in `image` directory

Instead of virtualbox, one can now also use docker, so the tool can run inside
a container. To install the tool into a docker container, run
`vagrant up --provider docker`.

Note that the automated installation may take long, as it will be
downloading an Ubuntu 16.04.2 image and installing the R build dependencies
to a fresh Ubuntu image. Should the installation fail or time out, it can
be re-started by `vagrant provision`. One can log in to the machine by
`vagrant ssh` to use the tools after successful install or to fix issues
should the installation fail. Note that a recent version of vagrant is
needed, e.g. on Ubuntu 14.04 one can install the `.DEB` package of vagrant
available from the [vagrant website](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
using `dpkg -i`.


For both native and virtual installation, to check R:

4. Get latest version of R: `svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk`
5. Build it using for rchk (run in R source tree)
	1. `. <rchk_root>/scripts/config.inc` (`. /opt/rchk/scripts/config.inc`)
	2. `<rchkroot>/scripts/build_r.sh` (`. /opt/rchk/scripts/build_r.sh`)
6. Run default rchk tools on R: `<rchkroot>/scripts/check_r.sh` (`/opt/rchk/scripts/check_r.sh`). Look for
files with suffixes `.maacheck` and `.bcheck` under `src`, e.g. 
`src/main/R.bin.bcheck` is the result of running `bcheck` tool on the R
binary. `<rchk_root>` is `/opt/rchk` with the virtual installation.

To check a package:

1. Prepare the environment for build
	1. `. <rchk_root>/scripts/config.inc` (`. /opt/rchk/scripts/config.inc`)
	2. `. <rchk_root>/scripts/cmpconfig.inc` (`. /opt/rchk/scripts/cmpconfig.inc`)
2. Install packages from within R: `./bin/R` (use `install.packages` or
`biocLite` or any other mechanism that in the end uses `install.packages`)
3. Check all installed packages: `<rchkroot>/scripts/check_package.sh`
4. The results of the checks will appear under `packages/lib/<package_dir>`,
again look for files with suffixes `.maacheck` and `.bcheck`.

For example, to check the "curl" package in the virtual installation:

```bash
svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk
cd trunk
. /opt/rchk/scripts/config.inc
/opt/rchk/scripts/build_r.sh

. /opt/rchk/scripts/config.inc
. /opt/rchk/scripts/cmpconfig.inc
echo 'install.packages("jpeg",repos="http://cloud.r-project.org")' |  ./bin/R --slave
/opt/rchk/scripts/check_package.sh jpeg
less packages/lib/jpeg/libs/jpeg.so.maacheck
```
